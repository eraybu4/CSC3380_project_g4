## Setup Instructions for Milestone 1: 11/02/2025

***Overview:***

Originally, the project began as a mobile app. The design was constructed by use of Figma. The team decided that due to the unfamiliarity of 
the two required programing languages (Kotlin and/or Swift), it would be best to work with a website instead.
As of now, two separate web prototypes currently exist (a login page and a rewards page).
The team intends to combine these to make one cohesive site. 

***Requirements:***

- Project Type: Web-based application
- Runtime: Any Web Browser
- Emulators: None Required
- Libraries: None as of yet

***How to Run:***

The team is currently working on pushing out the HTML files to the reposatory. 
Once accessible, open the HTML files directly in a browser of choice. 
Upon further development, the exact location of said HTML files will be given in an updated version of this file.
Until then, provided below is an image of one of the two prototypes.

***Backend Progress:***

The backend portion of this project is in the process of being pushed to the repository.
Once the backend components are accessible, they will be listed in an updated version of this file.

***Additional Notes:***

Any new information added will cause for an update to this file.
